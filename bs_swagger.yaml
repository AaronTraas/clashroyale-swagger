      description: >
        Get information about a single player by player tag. Player tags can be found either in game or by from club member lists.
        Note that player tags start with hash character '#' and that needs to be URL-encoded properly to work in URL, so for example player tag '#2ABC' would become '%232ABC' in the URL.
